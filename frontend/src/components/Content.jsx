          Capture The Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition where
          participants solve challenges to find hidden flags. These challenges
          test a wide range of skills in areas such as cryptography, reverse
          engineering, web security, and forensics.
        </p>

      <section>
        <p>CTF challenges can be broadly categorized into several types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Crypto:</strong> Challenges that involve encrypting or
            decrypting messages to find the flag.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reverse Engineering:</strong> Analyzing binary files to
            understand their functionality and extract hidden information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Web Security:</strong> Exploiting vulnerabilities in web
            applications to retrieve the flag.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Forensics:</strong> Analyzing data from disk images, memory
            dumps, or network traffic to find the flag.
          </li>
        </ul>
